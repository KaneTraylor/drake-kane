    <p>"Welcome! Welcome to <b>City-17.</b> You have chosen or have <b>been chosen</b> to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. I thought so much of City-17
    that I elected to have my administration here, <b>in the Citadel</b> so thoughtfully provided by <b>our Benefactors.</b> I've been proud to call City-17 my home. And so,
whether you are here to stay or passing through on your way to parts unknown; welcome to City-17, it's <b>safer</b> here." </p>
